# Club Site Vision
At minimum, the club site should describe the goals of the club, recent club news, and information about ongoing club projects/events. Ideally, the club site should allow all club members to have their own personal area. This could initially be something basic, like a list of their interests and experience. Eventually, it would be great to have each member able to maintain their own web development portfolio through the club site. This could bring a lot of attention to individuals but also the group as a whole. 

Having an interlinking history of members and projects could also be useful. This way you could search easily for people you have worked with previously or people who have particular experience. This could be really useful as a networking tool for people trying to find group members for a project, to share related job postings with other club members, etc.

# Possible Club Site Features
- Basic club information such as description/details of what the club does, club news, etc.
- User profiles with information like name, link to portfolio/personal page, expertise/interests, projects. This could give us a more public view of the information as well as improved ability to find others interested in similar things
- Information about major projects such as name, description, status (active/inactive), participating members, links to related resources
- Calendar including day/time/info for different events, ways for members to create/edit their own events
- Wiki integration to include the wiki currently hosted at https://github.com/Carleton-Web-Dev-Club/CWDC-Wiki or to provide a similar service (e.g., by hosting our own wiki software)
- Blog integration to allow members to post tutorials, projects, etc.
- [Club data API](./api/discussion.adoc) to support creation of alternate clients
